## About
![demo-gif](/resources/animated.gif?raw=true "demo")

Feeling bored with basic picture wallpapers? Want to play a quick game while all windows are minimzed? Well why not just run a full gameboy emulator as desktop wallpaper!

Don't want to play? then disable keyboard input & use Macro input, save sequence of moves & automatically play it back; Like an animated gif wallpaper.

Don't worry about performance overhead, it will pause when running fullscreen games or application.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Who asked for this?
Saw the suggestion on discord chat, got intrigued; took me longer than expected to make. Is this useless? maybe. Did I waste my time? Possibly. It was fun to make nonetheless :)

### High system usage?
The default style of blurred background is a bit expensive if you don't have dedicated graphics, just use different layout style such as "Simple". Regardless, when fullscreen application or game run it will goto ~0% usage.

### Not taking input?
Certain applications can interfere with focus, just click on desktop or taskbar to regain focus.

### Where is the source code?
I will update it later after cleanup & final update.
